🧭 1. Login Flow

On first launch → show onboarding screen.

User can choose Create Account or Already Have an Account.

After login, if biometric login is enabled in settings → next app launch should skip onboarding and go from splash → login screen (email & password).

Login layout similar to provided screenshot, but with email & password, not phone.

🏠 2. Home Screen & Admin Control

Remove “Opay”, “To Bank”, and “Withdraw” — keep only the services/products grid.

Each grid item can show notification threads from backend (e.g., promos or “awoof” alerts).

All banners and carousels are dynamic and managed by the admin panel:

Admin can send:

Carousel for onboarding screen.

Auto-sliding banners for home screen (top/middle/bottom).

Banners and carousels for every service/product screen, like Opay.


No static banners/carousels in the code — only display when backend sends data.

Layout should auto-adjust when banners exist.


Admin panel must allow complete management of all banners, carousels, and notifications.

⚙️ 3. Services & Products Screens

No static data — everything fetched dynamically from VTpass API.


Airtime screen

Input for phone number → auto-detect network icon.

Dropdown for manual network select.

Grid for quick top-up amounts + manual entry option.


Data screen

Tabs/filters for Daily, Monthly, Hot, etc.

Each tab loads relevant plans dynamically in grid view.


TV & Electricity

Dynamic grid of service providers (with icons & details from VTpass).

On selection → go to details input page → payment preview screen.


Payment Preview & Wallet System

Payment preview should fetch user wallet balance (from “Add Funds” section powered by Minify).

If the wallet is funded → allow direct payment deduction from wallet automatically.

Checkout flow should be like Opay — smooth transition from processing → success, showing animation and status.

All payments, wallet funding, and transactions must be trackable and manageable from the admin panel.


Banners and Carousels

All product/service screens must include auto-sliding banners and carousels (just like Opay), dynamically fetched per route from backend.

⚙️ 4. Settings & Admin Backend

Expand Admin Panel to:

Manage banners, carousels, notifications, and onboarding carousels.

Control wallet funding, payment deductions, and transaction history.

Oversee all VTpass integrations and product/service updates dynamically.
