# Admin Dashboard User Guide

## Accessing the Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is accessible at the main URL of your Replit deployment.

### Default Login

To create an admin user, you need to manually set a user's role to `'admin'` in the MongoDB database, or register a new user through the API and then update their role.

**Creating an admin user via MongoDB:**
1. Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Browse collections â†’ Find the `users` collection
3. Find or create a user
4. Edit the user document and set `role: "admin"`

**Or use the backend API:**
```bash
# Register a new user
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "name": "Admin User",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}

# Then manually update the role in MongoDB to "admin"
```
